# Real-World-List-Operations-using-Python# 🧮 Real-World List Operations using Python

This mini project demonstrates how to use Python’s powerful functional programming tools to manipulate and analyze numeric lists.  

It covers:

- ✅ `map()` — apply functions to all elements  
- ✅ `filter()` — extract items based on conditions  
- ✅ `reduce()` — reduce a list to a single value  
- ✅ `lambda` — write quick inline functions  
- ✅ List comprehension — concise one-line loops and filters  

---

## 🔍 Use Case:
Perform common data operations such as squaring numbers, filtering evens, multiplying all values, and combining logic — just like in real-world data preprocessing and transformation tasks.

---

## 📌 Tools Used:
- Python
- `functools.reduce`
- Functional programming mindset

## 📎 Sample Output:
```python
Squares: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]  
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  
Product: 3628800  
Doubled evens: [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]  
Squared odds: [1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
